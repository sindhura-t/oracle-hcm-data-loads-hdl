  - Worker
  - Assignment
  - Job
  - Position
  - Department
- Pre-load data validation rules
- Structured error handling and exception tracking
- Reconciliation reports using OTBI
- Governance documentation for HRIS teams

## Technologies Used
- Oracle HCM Cloud  
- HCM Data Loader (HDL)  
- Excel / CSV
